# Basics of Security
In this section we will look into the fundamental ideas about security.

# Let's talk
More often people usually use passwords containing their name, mobile number, etc.
such passwords can be easily guessed by an attacker.

### 1. Try to make stronger passwords.

I see, many people use the same password everywhere they've account (or want to create one).
This is suicidal. You can use same password but only if you're logging into a trusted website/app.
Trusted websites store your passwords in encrypted format. So even if an attacker gains access to the database,
they cannot login to your account because the password can't be simply decrypted.
Now suppose, some new website, is not trusted (at least by you :p) may or may not store the passwords with some encryption.
If they don't an attacker can simply login to your other account (google, facebook,etc.) if you're using the same password.

### 2. Don't use your regular password if the website/app you're logging in is not trusted, at least by you.

If you haven't heard about ```phishing``` , then you should. Phising is an old, traditional way to retrieve your account password. The basic idea behind phishing is to create a copy of login or whole website and allow user to login so as to save account credentials. 
eg. an attacker creates a copy of gmail page, which exactly looks similar to the original, but coded in a way that it will store credentials whenever someone tries to login through that page. Now the attacker will share the link of his phising page somehow (through mails, messages, web links, etc.) and attacker has all the credentials of all the users who tried to login through phishing page.

### 3. Always confirm the url of the website you're loggin in. Don't try to login with your original credentials on some fake, similar looking page having some other domain.
ie. don't try to login on phishing.etc/github (some github phishing page) with your original github.com credentials. 
Note that git-hub.com and github.com are two different domains. :D
