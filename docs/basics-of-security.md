# Basics of Security
In this section we will look into the fundamental ideas about security.

# Let's talk
More often people usually use passwords containing their name, mobile number, etc.
such passwords can be easily guessed by an attacker.

### 1. Try to make stronger passwords.

I see, many people use the same password everywhere they've account (or want to create one).
This is suicidal. You can use same password but only if you're logging into a trusted website/app.
Trusted websites store your passwords in encrypted format. So even if an attacker gains access to the database,
they cannot login to your account because the password can't be simply decrypted.
Now suppose, some new website, is not trusted (at least by you :p) may or may not store the passwords without any encryption.
If they don't an attacker can simply login to your other account (google, facebook,etc.) if you're using the same password.

### 2. Don't use your regular password if the website/app you're logging in is not trusted, at least by you.
